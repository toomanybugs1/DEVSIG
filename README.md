# DEVSIG

Welcome to the repository for our special interest group. Here is where our entire project will be stored. You must be added to the project before you can make any changes!

## Getting Started
Once you're on the project, you will need to install Unity 2019.3.3f1. Then you will need to clone this repository into your Unity projects folder. In the Unity hub, select Add Project and select the file generated from the clone.

Open up the project and go to Window->Github and sign in on the top right. You will need to enter your Github account information. Once you've signed in you can make changes to this repo.

After cloning and signing in, the project should be completely up to date. Go ahead and create a new scene (File->New Scene) and save it in the Scenes folder. From here, you can create your minigame room.

When making changes, make sure to save, commit, and push them often (leave meaningful commit summaries too, please). If you run into any trouble, feel free to message me on Slack.

## Development Guide
Everything you need to interact with is in the Assets folder. Inside are a few subfolders organized by asset type. Most everything is self explanatory. Prefabs are completed objects for reuse, and the first person controller is stored in the FirstPersonAIO Pack folder. If you're unsure where something you import/make should go, just ask!

Please make sure to sign your scripts so if something breaks we know who to reach out to (just a comment near the top with your name will do). If you need to change anything you didn't make, just message the Slack first.

I think that's just about everything so have fun! Again, just message me anytime if you need help with anything.
